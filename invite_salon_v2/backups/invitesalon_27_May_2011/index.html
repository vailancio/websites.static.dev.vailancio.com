            	<h2>Brilliant stuff! But how much does it cost?</h2>
                <p>We donโt have fixed fee. Just like a wedding, it depends on what you want. But unlike most vendors, we promise to be fair and transparent in our pricing. So no paying for Orchids and getting Lilies.</p>

                    <h2>Do we get to meet you guys to discuss the invite?</h2>
                    <p>We live and work in Goa. It offers the perfect environment to create beautiful invites. So if youโd like to do a pre-wedding honeymoon and come to Goa to discuss your invite, youโre more than welcome. In fact, weโll help you plan your trip: find the loveliest places to stay, the best restaurants and the most happening clubs!</p>
         
                    <p>Otherwise, weโre pretty good at doing stuff online and over phone. Weโve worked with hundreds of clients, from more than 25 different countries. And all of them have been satisfied with our understanding of what they wanted and what we made for them.</p>
                     
                    <p>*In rare cases, if you really, really want us to come over where you are (and are willing to pay for the travel), we just might.</p>

                <h2>Ok, so then how does it work?</h2>
                <p>Itโs really simple. You tell us roughly how much you want to spend on the invite. Based on that weโll give you a couple of options of what can be done. And once you choose the format and style, weโll ask you a lot of questions, about your relationship, about what you like, the kind of people you are... And then weโll suggest a creative idea around which the invite can be designed. Once you like the idea, weโll go ahead and make a beautiful invite for you!</p>

                <h2>Sounds good, but what about the printing / production?</h2>
                	<p>Getting your invite printed isnโt nearly as difficult now as it used to be a couple of years back. Weโll send you the print files for the invite and instructions for the 					                       printer. You can get it printed in your city.</p>
 
                     <p>If youโd like us to get the printing done, weโll get quotations from the printer and coordinate the printing. Weโll check the samples, make sure everything is perfect, get         the prints and courier them to you. For all the effort, weโll charge a little bit extra. Youโll have beautiful invites home delivered, without any hassle!</p>

                    <p>When the Americans were trying to get to the moon, they never let money come in the way. So youโre on the right track! While we arenโt โRocket Scientistsโ and wouldnโt know what to do with billions of dollars, we can definitely make an Invite thatโs out of the world. An invite on a bottle wine? Carved on marble? The only limit is your imagination... and ours!</p>

                <p>Sure. Weโd love to! We love kids and can make an amazing illustrated invite, with you son looking like โSupermanโ (or whatever his current Superhero fantasy is!)</p>			                </div>
